## FoodMate

**FoodMate** is an accessible, health-oriented recipe search website powered by [React](https://react.dev/), [MUI](https://mui.com/), and [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/). This webpage was created for my dissertation at the end of my undergraduate course at the University of Lincoln, and received a first grade mark as a result. The goal of this project was to assess what design and development principles ensured greater accessibility to users, whilst also promoting healthier dietary choices. FoodMate achieves this goal by giving the user the ability to filter recipes based on hundreds of dietary and health needs, allergies, preferences, and nutritional goals â€” all whilst following modern UX and accessibility guidelines such as WCAG 2.2 AA standards. In the image below, you can see the home page on the [website](https://foodmate.dev/home), and from here the user is able to search across a myriad of different pages that will help with either finding recipes, or configuring the settings on the site.
